# Ionic-Polarons

For a simple demonstration of the DMC calculation, use Matlab to run dmcSimple.m.

To see the main code used for the calculations in our paper "[Ion solvation in atomic baths: From snowballs to polarons](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ntls.20240006)", see dmc.m. Run dmc.m for a demonstration.

To see the data and plotting code for the figures in the paper, see dmcPlots.m

To see the basin hopping method, see basin.py.

To see the technique for retrieving intermediate results from a calculation that is still running on the cluster, see intermediate.m.
