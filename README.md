For a simple demonstration of the DMC calculation, use Matlab to run dmcSimple.m.

To see the main code used for the calculations in the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10639), see dmc.m. Run dmc.m for a demonstration.

To see the data and plotting code for the figures in the paper, see dmcPlots.m

To see the basin hopping method, see basin.py.

To see the technique for retrieving intermediate results from a calculation that is still running on the cluster, see intermediate.m.
